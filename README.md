## Detection and Response Capabilities
Detection & Response Capabilities is about creating an organization to identify how attackers might circumvent your organization’s defensive technologies.  Since 100% protection isn’t achievable, it’s about effective incident response to cyber incidents such as ransomware or business email compromise.  This section also includes Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning.

## Laws, Regulations, & Oversight

## Enabling Technologies
Enabling Technologies is about enabling businesses to create digital transformation.  This is helpful when organizations feel their technology is dated and want to adopt newer technologies such as Artifical Intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, Serverless Computing, Biometrics, Augmented/Virtual Reality, Blockchain, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Quantum Computing, etc.  Essentially this type of CISO focuses on technology transformation to enable the business.
