## Defensive Technologies
Defensive Technologies is about creating defense in depth in an organization to protect against a multitude of attacks.  Knowledge of these domains is key as it’s one of the most common things auditors assess in an organization since it’s required for things like PCI compliance.

## Detection and Response Capabilities
Detection & Response Capabilities is about creating an organization to identify how attackers might circumvent your organization’s defensive technologies.  Since 100% protection isn’t achievable, it’s about effective incident response to cyber incidents such as ransomware or business email compromise.  This section also includes Offensive Security Concepts, Business Continuity, and Disaster Recovery Planning.

## Enabling Technologies
Enabling Technologies is about enabling businesses to create digital transformation.  This is helpful when organizations feel their technology is dated and want to adopt newer emerging technologies such as Artifical Intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, Serverless Computing, Biometrics, Augmented/Virtual Reality, Blockchain, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Quantum Computing, etc.  Essentially this type of CISO focuses on technology transformation to enable the business.

## Governance
Governance is about understanding what technology your organization uses so you can effectively manage it through a process.  This can be particularly helpful when you need a CISO who can optimize how your resources are spent.

## Identity & Access Management
Identity & Access Management is about limiting the scope of an attacker who could cause harm to your organization.  This is a key skill set for organizations that use lots of technologies from external vendors/providers. This knowledge is also helpful for organizations where data sharing agreements with partners and third parties is common.

## Laws, Regulations, & Oversight
Laws, Regulations, and Oversight is about ensuring compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.  This is particularly useful in highly regulated industries (Financial Services or Medical Industry).  Organizations that are coming out of a data breach scenario are also likely to find increased scrutiny by regulators/auditors.
